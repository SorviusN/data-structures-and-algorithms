## Approach & Efficiency
Created with Josh Haddock, Jona Brown & Steven Boston
We detailed a problem domain specifying the requirements of the challenge
Then Made a Visual representation of the array value swapping
Roughed out the steps for our algorithm
Wrote out Pseudo code detailing in plain english our codes intended structure and behavior
Outlined steps to verify our solution and test possible edge case
