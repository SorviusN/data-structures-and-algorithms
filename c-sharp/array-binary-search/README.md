Whiteboard Process

### Created by Jona Brown & Ben Ibarra
We detailed a problem domain specifying the requirements of the challenge
- Then Made a Visual representation of the array value swapping
- Roughed out the steps for our algorithm
- Wrote out Pseudo code detailing in plain-ish english our codes intended structure and behavior
- Outlined steps to verify our solution and test possible edge
    cases

Approach & Efficiency

    Given array and search key
    Loop through the array
