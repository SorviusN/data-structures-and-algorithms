# Hashtables
Hash Tables are data structures that use key/value pairs to store data, both in the form of a string.
## Challenge
Create a hashtable from scratch with the appropriate methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
All of the methods are O(n) time (linear) as finding one value within just involves looping through the entire linked list.

## API

Add - Given a key and value, inserts the pair into the linked list for later access.

Get - Given a key, searches for the value associated with the key inside of the linked list.

Contains - Given a key, returns a true or false based on whether or note the key exists in the table.

Hash - Given a key, returns a specific index for the key value pair to fall into.
